# GMITPyProg2021
GMIT CyberSecurity Python Labs

This repository contains a directory corresponding to each week of class in Programming for CyberSecurity, e.g. week01, week02.

Each of those directories contains the problem solutions for the task sheet/labs assigned by the lecturer, Andrew Beatty, on the corresponding week.

This repository also contains a directory called Practice. This directory contains practice programs I have written to try improve my programming skills.
Many of the programs are based on questions posed on the online website CareerCup, tag - Google.
There is a readme.txt file in the Practice directory which lists each program by name and summarises what it is trying to do. If the program is a work in progress,
then this is stated.
New directory 'Team' added to allow me to run another student's code to see where they are encountering the problem.
