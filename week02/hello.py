# This program is based on Week 2 Labs  for programming for CyberSecurity, FirstPrograms.pdf 
# The labs were set by lecturer Andrew Beatty, GMIT
# This program satisfies steps 3,4,5 of FirstPrograms.pdf
#
#	3. Create a directory called week02 (Done one command line, not in program)
#	4. In week02 create a file called hello.py that just says hello
#	5. Save the file (CTRL+S) and run it 
# Modified as follows
#	6. Change the code to say hello your name 
#	7. Donâ€™t save it and see that when you run it, the output is still hello
#	8. Save it and see that the output has changed.
#	9. Make a mistake with the syntax and try to run it. - for this I removed the quotes so hello became an undefined variable instead of a string

print ("hello Adele")
