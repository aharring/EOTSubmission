# This program is based on Week 2 Labs  for programming for CyberSecurity, FirstPrograms.pdf 
# The labs were set by lecturer Adrew Beatty, GMIT
# This program satisfies steps 10 & 11 of FirstPrograms.pdf
#
#	10. Write a program called multiply.py that outputs what 111 * 555 is
#	
#	11. Why does this print out nothing, when run
#		Originally the program just creates the variable answer and assigns it the product of 111*555 then ceases execution
#		The answer must be expressly sent to stdout/printed

answer = 111*555 # Point 10 of FirstPrograms
print (answer)	 # Point 11 of FirstPrograms
