# The code example below creates a secure connection with Gmailâ€™s SMTP server, 
# using the SMTP_SSL() of smtplib to initiate a TLS-encrypted connection. 
# The default context of ssl validates the host name and its certificates then  optimizes the security of the connection.
# One this is done a simple text email is sent
# Important OAuth2 was enabled to improve security. Instructions found here https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python
